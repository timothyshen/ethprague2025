# AnyStake

**The Future of DeFi is Cross-Chain ‚Äî Powered by Flow, Ethereum, and More**

AnyStake is a next-generation cross-chain staking protocol that aggregates liquidity and staking opportunities across Flow, Ethereum, Hedera and other leading blockchains. Built for seamless user experience and global liquidity, AnyStake enables users to stake, bridge, and earn yield across multiple chains from a single interface.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Cross-Chain Staking Aggregator:** Stake assets from Flow, Ethereum, Hedera and more into unified high-yield pools.
- **Flow Integration:** Directly bridge and stake assets from Flow, unlocking new DeFi opportunities.
- **Unified Dashboard:** Track balances, rewards, and positions across all supported chains in real time.
- **Seamless UX:** Effortless wallet connection, chain switching, and transaction monitoring.
- **LayerZero Messaging:** Secure, reliable cross-chain communication and asset transfer.

## üåâ Why Cross-Chain & Why LayerZero?
- **Breaks DeFi Silos:** Bridges liquidity between Flow and EVM chains but not using bridge.
- **Composable Primitives:** Enables new DeFi strategies and products that rely on multi-chain flows of assets and data.
- **Global Liquidity:** Connects Flow to the global DeFi ecosystem, maximizing yield and opportunity.
